            <h3>1. Subscription Rental Model</h3>
            <p>
              All CRM workspace tiers (Starter, Growth, Professional, Business, and Enterprise) are provided as cloud-hosted software subscriptions on a prepaid monthly or annual recurring billing cycle.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Cancellation Requests</h3>
            <p>
              A Company Administrator or Owner may submit a subscription cancellation request at any time directly through the protected customer portal. Once cancelled, your tenant workspace remains fully active and accessible until the conclusion of the current paid billing period. No further automated renewals will be charged after cancellation.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              Subscription rental fees are billed in advance for the chosen billing term (monthly or annual). Due to immediate cloud tenant provisioning, storage allocation, and server resource reservation:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Monthly subscription payments are non-refundable once the billing cycle has begun.</li>
              <li>Annual subscriptions cancelled within seven (7) calendar days of the initial purchase or renewal are eligible for a prorated refund minus standard payment gateway transaction charges and the first month’s fee.</li>
              <li>No refunds are issued for partial month usage, mid-cycle downgrades, or unused user seat limits.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Failed Payments & Grace Periods</h3>
            <p>
              If an automatic renewal payment fails, our payment gateway will retry processing according to standard retry cadences. The platform grants a five (5) business day grace period during which workspace access remains active. If payment remains uncollected after the grace period, the company account is temporarily suspended until payment is verified.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Data Retrieval Upon Expiry</h3>
            <p>
              Following subscription cancellation or expiration, company administrators may export all tenant leads, customers, tasks, and report data in CSV format for up to thirty (30) calendar days before permanent deletion from active database clusters.
